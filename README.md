# NYEclock
This is just something that I put together for the projectors at a music venue I own. I wanted to project the countdown with out adds or anything else. Just white on black. I will end up adding Happy New Years in big bold letters as soon as the timer hits 0. I am also planning to set inputs so you can add your own date to count down to with a custom message.
